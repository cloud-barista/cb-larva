# cb-network

cb-network is under-study. Proof of concept (POC) of **cb-subnet** is in progress.

## Overview of cb-network
cb-network is Global Network Service in Cloud-Barista. The objectvie is <ins>**to provide a unified and efficient global network service on Multiple CSPs' heterogeneous network.**</ins>   
We hope to make cb-network independent from CSP's network.   
cb-network includes cb-subnet, cb-dns, and cb-loadbalancer. Further items are welcome.

We are mainly ressearching and developing **cb-subnet** of cb-network. cb-dns and cb-loadbalancer will be added.
**cb-subnet** performs creating a common network for multiple VMs and supports communication betwwen VMs.
