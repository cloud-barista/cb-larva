We incubate (research and develop) the new technologies in order to **“Contact to the Multi-Cloud”**. Proof of concept (POC) of new technologies will be performed in this repostory. <ins>**Contributions are always welcome.**</ins> :heart_eyes:

Note that, you can use and share useful information at [Cloud-Barista's coffeehouse](https://github.com/cloud-barista/cb-coffeehouse).


## Challenges in Cloud-Barista
CB-Larva mainly considers ***multi-cloud network technology (cb-network)*** for now.

The topics below are wide open.
- **cb-storage**: Multi-cloud storage technology to support storage for the distributed cloud services
- **cb-secret**: Secret(e.g., configs, credentials, DB access information) management independently and efficiently from source repositories. It will be researched in a private repository(It has secrets :)). If you have any interest in it, feel free to contact me.
- ***but not limited.***

We’re waiting for your creative ideas. :blush:
